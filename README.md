## Inspiration

[The Art of Code - Dylan Beattie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6avJHaC3C2U)

## Based on

Ben Awad's video: [React Hooks Project Tutorial - Game of Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvVt11mPuM0) (I used vanilla JS with React)

Single File idea from this blog post by Kent C Dodds: [Super Simple Start to React](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/super-simple-start-to-react)

## Known flaws

-   You shouldn't make apps like this.
-   The method is probably the opposite of optimization.
-   Live cells don't "cross" the boundary. Rather, they just stop; hence violating the rule of "infinite grid".
